# money-maker
Need a team. Players must specialize in HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, MYSQL, and Payment Gateways.
It's the php and mysql and payment gateways I have the most trouble with. I CAN do the rest myself,
but coding is not really my thing.
I can not divolg too much on a public forum. 
I can tell you that this project is a relatively simple build. It is a new platform for product sales 
And development. ALL products will need this platform, so it is very important that we be the ones
to develop this. Technology and marketing is transforming. If we do not build this today, someone else
Will build it tomorrow, then THAT person will be google rich. I don't want it to be THAT person. I 
Want it to be US!
Email me at lifeearned@gmail.com. have the subject say what area you are best in, php, javascript, so on.
